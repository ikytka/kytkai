# kytkai – Documenting my journey in the AI world.
I have been using AI for a couple of years, but not systematically. Occasionally, I tried various prompts, more elaborate prompts, and specialised AI tools. I watched some videos introducing important AI concepts, time-saving techniques, and must-try scenarios. With the increasing amount of news about the growing power of AI tools, I feel absolutely overwhelmed. Therefore, I decided to give my efforts some structure. I plan to document my learning journey, so I can revisit different moments, reflect on my progress, and either change direction or continue from where I left off. My path is not structured in advance like a curriculum. I want to start like a backpacker with a guidebook and see where it takes me. I think of it as a travel blog, but this time I am exploring the world of AI.

## My background
I have an MA in psychology and a BA in journalism, but no technology degree. I work full-time at an IT company, have two children and one dog. At night, I sleep. The great thing is that my employer supports learning about AI during working hours. I work in non-programming roles in IT industry for many years, so coding is not something I know. Once I run print('Hello, World!') in Python and I know how to close vim. 

## My approach
I decided to document my journey and share it publicly mainly for three reasons: 1) public commitment helps me maintain my motivation and reduces the risk of stopping the next day, 2) perhaps one day someone will find some information mentioned here useful, and 3) it is a way to receive feedback or recommendations from wandering readers on the topics I will be exploring (been there, done that, have you tried...? all these are highly appreciated).

My idea is to write notes with examples I have used. Occasionally, I will reflect on my attempts. As I said, do not expect a detailed plan to be followed. I will do what I feel is working.
