# What is in my tool box
* **Claude** (Sonnet 4.6, free) - my first choice chat. I really like their artifacts.
* **ChatGPT** (5.2, paid) - great voice chat when I feel like talking and having a discusion rather than typing. Safe for my work purposes - approved by our IT Security department 🔐
* **Gemini** (paid, part of our family subscription) - where do I find it??? 🤔
* **Copilot** (paid, part of our company subscription) - usually I end up here when I need to figure out something about Microsoft products
* **Eleven Reader by ElevenLabs** (free) - copy and paste text that I want to listen to if there is not another simple way (like build-in iOS functions)
* **Make.com** - created one scenario there that I am not really proud of, but it works. I see opportunities here, but I have not priotized my time to play more with it.
* **Perplexity** (free) – accidentaly clicked download on my phone
* **Poe** (free) – probably downloaded out of curiosity

Well, when I see it all, it is quite a lot of tools. And I am sure I forgot some, and uninstall some more.

I knew the term FOMO (fear of missing out), but today I learned there is also FOBO (fear of being obsolete). And right after that I came across an article ["GenAI and the psychology of work"](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tics.2025.04.009) by Erik Hermann, Stefano Puntoni, and Carey K. Morewedge. By quickly skimming the text and thinking how to approach it, I found two terms I was not certain about their meaning. So I asked ChatGPT.

```
what are these two psychological terms: direct resolution, symbolic self- completion ?
```
Good. No I know. But wait, what if I remove the context? So I opened a new chat and tried it.

```
what does it mean: direct resolution, symbolic self- completion ?
```
The answer was also good but I could see the difference that the second result is meant for general public and does not contain references to psychological literature. Nothing new, just never tried to compare results of two similarly defined prompts.

By the way the term "symbolic self-completion" partialy explains my effort to document publicly my learning journey 🤭

🧠 I want to try comparing results more often to see the difference.
